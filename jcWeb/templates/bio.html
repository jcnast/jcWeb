							I am a 23 year old programmer who grew up in Britich Columbia and has lived in Ontario for the past 10 years. I went to the University of Waterloo for Mathematical Physics, then switched into Applied Mathematics so that I could take more Computer Science Courses. I graduated this year with a Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours) and have completed 5 Co-op terms. I am passionate about programming and actively try to expand my knowledge base and find practical applications for interesting ideas. My current infatuation is with SDL to practice C++ and have a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of game-loops that are typically handled by engines (collisions, physics, ...). I enjoy finding solutions to difficult problems and approach every challenge with logical reasoning and a desire to understand. If I get an error when coding, I make sure to understand the cause as well as the solution before being satisfied. I learn very quickly and am able to incoroporate the experience of others into my own repetoire, fueling my growth when in a team environment. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I am working towards being employed as a Game Designer, as it is both my passion and sis something I have a strong intuition for. To me there are two integral aspects to creating an enjoyable game, programming and design. The programming aspect of developing games appeals to me as each mechanic represents a unique puzzle to solve; how to make the code as efficient as possible without losing any of the effectiveness, and ensure the interaction between game elements remains intuitive to the player. The design portion can make or break a game, as you aim to provide a streamlined and interactive game wihtout making the player feel limited or forced to play a certain way. I believe that these two aspects must fit perfectly together to have a truly wonderful game, and I hope to be able to add my understanding of both to a game in the future.

						<h5><b>Game Development</b></h5>
						<p>
							My professional game development experience comes from a Co-op term working at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/">Games Institute</a> (University of Waterloo) under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/about/people">Neil Randall</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-brown-01324420">Mike Brown</a>. Together we made two phone applications, <a href="http://quantumcats.ca/#home">Quantum Cats</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UW_GI.qncAliceandSchrodinger&hl=en">Alice and Schrodinger<a/>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="http://quantumcats.ca/#home"><b>Quantum Cats</b></a> is an angry-birds clone with the special abilities cenetered around the world of quantum mechanics. The intent was to provide a fun and intuitive window into the quantum worlds in the hopes to spark interest in people of all ages. We used three well-known quantum properties: Superposition, Uncertainty, and Quantum Tunneling, as well as a standard Newtonian Physics cat for comparison to how phyiscs works to our eyes. I was involved in the whole process, from prototyping, testing, feedback and launching the final game. As such, I was a major voice in the final result and provided many key ideas in having the game be as it is now. As my first professional and biggest game to date, I learnt an absolutely obscene amount from the game creation experience as well as the from those I worked with. Fortunately for me, Mike Brown was more than willing to share his experience and knowledge from his experience as a professional game developer, and so I left with a much stronger understanding of what goes into and is required for professional development.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UW_GI.qncAliceandSchrodinger&hl=en"><b>Alice and Schrodinger</b><a/> is a self-guided tour aimed at providing insight to the goings-on of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mike-ophelia-lazaridis-quantum-nano-centre/">Quantum Nano Centre</a> on campus at the University of Waterloo. During an open-house event, participants had the option to use the app and unlock information as they roamed the building, learning about the building itself, the reasearch being done, and the future plans for the building. I was the lead developer for this app and so was in charge of getting all the plugins in working order and testing everything to make sure it worked. We included NFC Chip and iBeacon integration to unlock information within the game and to help guide the participants around the building. To integrate the two features, I had to dive into the documentation provided for the iBeacon plugin and write my own small java program to interact with the Android NFC reader. As this game is primarily UI, I was able to learn how UI is incorporated and how to make the app have a nice appearance with minimal artwork provided and still be easily understandable and interactable.

						<h5><b>Web Development</b></h5>
						<p>
							My primary web development experience comes from two Co-op terms working with the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-computing/">Science Computing Department</a> (University of Waterloo) under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-computing/about/people">Paul Miskovsky</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science-computing/about/people">Mikro Vucicevich</a>. During this time I helped develop two applications that are now in use campus-wide, <a href="http://whynot.uwaterloo.ca/evaluate/">eValuate</a> and <a href="http://whynot.uwaterloo.ca/markbox/">Markbox</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="http://whynot.uwaterloo.ca/evaluate/"><b>eValuate</b></a> is an application for students to evaluate and comment on their instructors and courses taken while attending the University of Waterloo. The goal is to reduce the time associated with the course evaluations, in terms of processing and collection time, as well as cutting the costs. As such, it now provides many additional features, such as being able to easily compare any professors and courses from any year and being able to monitor the data collection results and the best way to collect as much data as possible. My primary responsibility was to provide parsers to import legacy data and provide back-end management to easily create thousands of surveys for hundreds of classes with specific requirements as easily as possible, and to then be able to modify them painlessly without impacting the data already collected.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="http://whynot.uwaterloo.ca/markbox/"><b>Markbox</b></a> is a test creation and marking suite done online in order to replace scantron exams and make marking exams a smoother and more transparent process. Once you create a test, you can produce as many copies as you want, with the option to randomize question appearance, to hand out to the students. The exams, once completed, are then scanned, submitted online and automatically marked to then be emailed directly to the students so that they are aware of how the tests were marked (currently you do not get scantron papers back so students are unable to verify no marking mistakes were made). This was done by incoporating a program called <a href="http://home.gna.org/auto-qcm/">AMC</a> to handle the scanning and marking process. I dove into their code and database set-up to understand the process before writing scripts to use the software and provide additional statistics that were not previously offered. My primary responsibility was to create an online interface for the gateway between what was needed and what AMC provided.
